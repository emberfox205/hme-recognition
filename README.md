# HME Recognition

This repository contains a Handwritten Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition system that translates handwritten mathematical expressions into sequences of symbols and relations. The project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with bidirectional LSTM cells and uses Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for training.

## Technologies Used

- PyTorch Lightning
- Bidirectional LSTM
- Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)
- CROHME 2019 dataset
- Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
